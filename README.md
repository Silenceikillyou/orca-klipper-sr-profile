# orca-klipper-sr-profile
full profile with STL for the printer model
the stl is stolen from CURA and repositioned to work with orcaslicer
now adding my printer.cfg for people who are klipperizing SR, no need for a second repository for that one

-also printer.cfg has klipperscreen settings for running it on an old android phone and Crowsnest for timelapses with command in OrcaSlicer to take a picture on every layer change
-should have mentiononed earlier, this is for SR with 5015 cooling fans and OMG V2s extruder, so if you have stock fans ramp up the cooling to 100% and calibrate your e-steps

adding a new full profile with conservative 150mm/s speed and lower accel for people like me who do not have the nerves to tune it to perfection and just want to print
